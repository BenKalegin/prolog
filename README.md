How to Run this Project
-------------------------
Most of this project is done as series of unit tests.  To get an idea of how to use the Prolog compiler, check out the test 'FarmerProblemHasTwoDistinctSolutions'.

You can also run up the IDE (`Prolog.IDE.csproj`) which currently features a simple debugger allowing you to step through your program while watching the solution tree being built.
